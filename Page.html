            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has always interested me. 
                I first used AI in my Sec 3 Computing+ Coursework. 
                Implementing it into my teamâ€™s glove to recognise Sign Language gestures and translate them to letters. 
                Later, I went to a Python Programming Camp where I learned about reinforcement learning (RL) and insight into the coding industry. 
                Afterwards, I researched more about AI. I came across Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), a method to predict stocks, which I plan to do soon. 
                During my research, I found possible careers like data analyst and actuary which align with my interest.
